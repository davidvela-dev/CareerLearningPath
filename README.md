# Learning Path – Software Engineering
This repository documents my learning path throughout my studies and personal growth in Software Engineering.  
It includes documentation, exercises, and complete projects covering both academic foundations and practical software development areas.

Software Engineering offers a wide range of professional paths. During my studies, I often found myself uncertain about which area to specialize in.  
This repository is an attempt to organize that journey and provide a structured overview of the field.

The goal of this work is:
- To serve as a personal learning record and concepts organized from an experienced perspective
- To act as a guide for students entering the software field, helping them understand core concepts and explore different areas before choosing a specialization
