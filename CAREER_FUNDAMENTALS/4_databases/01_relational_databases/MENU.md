# Relational Databases

Non-Relational Databases explores data storage models beyond the traditional relational approach, focusing on scalability, flexibility, and performance. This subject covers key-value, document, column-oriented, and graph databases, along with their use cases and trade-offs. Students learn how to model unstructured and semi-structured data, design schemas optimized for distributed systems, and select appropriate NoSQL technologies to support high-availability, big data, and cloud-based applications.
